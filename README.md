# CSV-to-mongo
I created this small app to insert rows in a mongodb collection from a csv file, a task that was dreaded when I had to do it several times a day. 
The catch is that the index.js file needs to modified according to the desired schema, and should match the mongodb collection schema as well. Include the csv file to imported inside the root directory.
Enjoy!
